# Event-Driven Stock Prediction
<sub>(_because anything without is only marginally better than predicting winning numbers_)<sub>


### //TODO
*Preparation Stage* 
- obtain Kaggle market data
- scrape news data
- store data with frequency, news source into database (mongodb?)
- scope possible models, write findings in Notes section

*Training Stage*
- test and retrain, rinse and repeat


*Finalizing Stage*
- simple UI to display ups and downs, overlapped with major news?
- get the bread, roll in the dough
