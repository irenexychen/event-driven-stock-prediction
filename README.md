# Event-Driven Stock Prediction
<sub>(_because anything without is only marginally better than predicting winning numbers_)<sub>


### //TODO
**Preparation Stage**
- obtain Kaggle market data
- scrape news data
- store data with frequency, news source into database (mongodb?)
- scope possible models, write findings in Notes section

**Training Stage**
- test and retrain, rinse and repeat


**Finalizing Stage**
- simple UI to display ups and downs, overlapped with major news?
- get the bread, roll in the dough


### Data Source
Stock Market: https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs
New Source: find google scraper
